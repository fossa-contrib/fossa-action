# Fossa Action

[![Builds, tests & co](https://github.com/fossa-contrib/fossa-action/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fossa-contrib/fossa-action/actions)
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B7767%2Fgithub.com%2Ffossa-contrib%2Ffossa-action.svg?type=small)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B7767%2Fgithub.com%2Ffossa-contrib%2Ffossa-action?ref=badge_small)

## Synopsis

The action sets up and caches the latest release of `fossa-cli`, infer the
correct configuration from the current system state, analyze the project for a
list of its dependencies, and upload the results to FOSSA.

## Roadmap

This action aims to provide an OS-neutral interface to `fossa-cli`, and so will
not add features that only work on one operating system. It will also track the
latest release of `fossa-cli`.

## Usage

### Push-only API token

If you are an open-source project maintainer, you probably want to check pull
requests from external contributors with FOSSA, but it's impossible to do with
secrets when the workflow runs on the pull request event due to GitHub's
constraints. However, FOSSA has the
[push-only API](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token)
token, allowing you to safely check pull requests.

There is no problem with this:

```yml
- name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data
  uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2
  with:
    fossa-api-key: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  #                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

This will cause an error on the pull request event:

```yml
- name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data
  uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2
  with:
    fossa-api-key: ${{ secrets.FOSSA_API_KEY }}
  #                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### How to specify the version

There is a point that is particularly easy to misunderstand. It's where you
specify the version of the action _itself_.

```yml
- name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data
  uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2
  #                               ^^^
  with:
    fossa-api-key: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

We recommend that you include the version of the action. We adhere to
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org), it's safe to use the major version
(`v1`) in your workflow. If you use the master branch, this could break your
workflow when we publish a breaking update and increase the major version.

```yml
steps:
  # Reference the major version of a release (most recommended)
  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2
  # Reference a specific commit (most strict)
  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@6728dc6
  # Reference a semver version of a release (not recommended)
  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2.0.0
  # Reference a branch (most dangerous)
  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@master
```

### Example workflow

```yml
name: License Scanning

on:
  - pull_request
  - push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout tree
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data
        uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2
        with:
          fossa-api-key: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

## Inputs

- `fossa-api-key`: This input is used to upload the results of the build
  analysis.
- `github-token`: This input is used to get the latest release of `fossa-cli`
  from GitHub API.
- `endpoint`: This input is used to specify which fossa endpoint to use.
- `skip-test`: This input is used to specify whether to execute
  [`fossa test`](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md/#fossa-test).
  This takes a long time, so it's set to `true` by default.
